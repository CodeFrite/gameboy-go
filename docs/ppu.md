# Registers
## DIV@FF04 - Divider Register (R/W)
- This register is incremented at rate of 16384Hz (~16779Hz on SGB). Note that DIV is always counting, regardless of the TAC register.
- Writing any value to this register resets it to 0x00
- This register is reset when executing the stop instruction, and only begins ticking again once stop mode ends.

## TIMA@FF05 - Timer Counter (R/W)
- This timer is incremented at the clock frequency specified by the TAC register ($FF07).
- When the value overflows (exceeds $FF) it is reset to the value specified in TMA (FF06) and an interrupt is requested.

## TMA@FF06 - Timer Modulo (R/W)
- When TIMA overflows, it is reset to the value in this register and an interrupt is requested.
- Example of use: if TMA is set to $FF, an interrupt is requested at the clock frequency selected in TAC (because every increment is an overflow)
- However, if TMA is set to $FE, an interrupt is only requested every two increments, which effectively divides the selected clock by two. Setting TMA to $FD would divide the clock by three, and so on.
- If a TMA write is executed on the same M-cycle as the content of TMA is transferred to TIMA due to a timer overflow,
- the old value is transferred to TIMA.

## TAC@FF07 - Timer Control (R/W)
- This register controls the timer, determining the clock source and frequency.
